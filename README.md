# The Foundation Package Manager
## fpm project

I'm bored, and have a whole project going, so
I figured I'd create a package manager.

## Map around the project.

core branch - The release branch of the project.
Tested to be working.

live branch - The working branch of the project.
Not fully tested, script is typically fresh off the griddle.
